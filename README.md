# Persona
Persona is a NADRA inspired database system made by using SQLite and uses Data Structures. Key features include: CRUD Operations, perpetrator finding that narrows down the possible list of suspects based on the personality traits defined, demographic search and also we added a fun feature that gives future career prediction based on perssonality traits that we input during adding a user.
